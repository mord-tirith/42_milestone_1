Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Take a minute to remember to breathe, 'cause we're losing our minds

Rebel just to say that you did, to impress every hate-spewing keyboarded kid

Can we live a real life? A real life; and do we even know what that means?

Can we live a real life between the devil and the digital sea?

Hey! Hey! Hey!

With every photo you are taking my soul but you know

Where anything goes

Check the yes, check the no, in the box below

But can we live a real life? A real life; and do we even know what that means?

Can we live a real life between the devil and the digital sea?

A new canon is coming up

And it's calling on the World

Move fast and out of control

Do anything you want

No mind, no memory

Just your allegiance to the fad

Hate, love, sex coming in clean

Taking over all of our hands

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Can we live a real life? A real life; and do we even know what that means?

Can we live a real life between the devil and the digital sea?

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!
