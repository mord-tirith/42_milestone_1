Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Sit back from the edge of your seat, if you can

Where anything goes

Let's let everyone know, anything goes

Can we live a real life; and know people outside machines?

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Every shot is just another to show to the people that live

Criticize every poor asshole 'cause you know you're the judge

Where anything goes

Can we live a real life; and know people outside machines?

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Can we live a real life; and know people outside machines?

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!
