Red like roses fills my dreams and brings me to the place you rest
White is cold and always yearning, burdened by a royal test
Black the beast descends from shadows
Yellow beauty burns gold

I couldn't take it couldn't stand another minute
Couldn't bear another day without you in it
All of the joy that I had know for all my life
Was stripped away from me the minute that you died
To have you in my life was all I ever wanted
But now without you I'm a soul forever haunted
Can't help but feel that I had taken you for granted
No way in hell that I can ever comprehend this

I wasn't dreaming when they told me you were gone
I was wide awake and feeling that they had to be wrong
How could you leave me when you swore that you would stay?
Now I trapped inside a nightmare every single fucking day
It's like a movie, but there's not a happy ending
Every scene fades black and there's no pretending
This little fairy tale doesn't seem to end very well
There's no knight in shining armor who will wake me from the spell
I know you didn't plan this
You try to do what's right
But in the middle of this madness
I'm the one (I'm the one, I'm the one) you left to win this fight

Red like roses
Fills my head with dreams and finds me
Always closer
To the emptiness and sadness
That has come to take the place of you

I Know you're broken down by anger and by sadness
You feel I left you in a world that's full of madness
Wish I could talk to you if only for a minute
Make you understand the reasons why I did it
I wanna tell you that you're all that ever mattered
Want you to know that for eternity I'm shattered
I tried so hard just to protect you, but I failed to
And in a prison of abandonment I've jailed you

I never planned that to I would leave you there alone
I was sure that I would see you when I made it back home
And all the times I swore that it would be ok
Now I'm nothing but a liar and you're thrown into the fray
This bedtime story ends with misery ever after
The pages are torn and there's no final chapter
I didn't have a choice. I did what I had to do
I made a sacrifice but forced a bigger sacrifice in you

I know you've lived a nightmare
I cause you so much pain
But baby please don't do what I did
I don't want (I don't want, I don't want) you to waste your life in vain

Red like roses
Fills my head with dreams and finds me
Always closer
To the emptiness and sadness
That has come to take the place of you

You not the only who needed me
I thought you understood
You were the one I needed and you left me
As I always feared you would
Would I change it if I could?
It doesn't matter how
The petals scatter now
Every nightmare just discloses
It's your blood that's red like roses
And no matter what I do
Nothing ever takes the place of you

Red like roses
Fills my head with dreams and finds me
Always closer
To the emptiness and sadness
That has come to take the place of you
